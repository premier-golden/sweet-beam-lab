Collagen production naturally declines from early adulthood, typically from the mid-20s, meaning existing collagen fibres are renewed less tightly and less regularly over time, reflecting normal age-related changes in protein structure.",

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Why doesn't Collagen Glow Up contain vitamin C?",
    a: [
      "Our previous version of Collagen Glow Up included vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.",
      "However, we found that these ingredients negatively impacted the taste, dissolvability and effectiveness. That's why, in response to customer feedback and product testing, we updated our formulation last year.",
      "The current version features a higher-grade, triple-filtered collagen that's purer, cleaner, and more effective on its own.",
      "When vitamin C is combined with collagen in powdered form, it can cause unpleasant smells and changes in texture, breakdown of collagen proteins over time, reduced effectiveness due to exposure to moisture, oxygen, heat, and pH fluctuations.",
      "These issues are common when Vitamin C is mixed with powder unless special (and often expensive) stabilisation techniques are used—like microencapsulation or individual packaging. We prefer to keep things simple, honest, and effective.",
      "Vitamin C does not improve the absorption of collagen, but rather assists with your body's natural collagen formation. These are two separate biological processes, with absorption referring to how collagen peptides are taken up through your digestive system into your bloodstream, and formation referring to your body's natural process of making new collagen proteins, which vitamin C assists with.",
      "It's also important to stay well hydrated, as hydration plays a key role in how your body processes collagen.",
      "Does the product still work? Absolutely. We sell over 250,000 packs of Collagen Glow Up every month, and the results speak for themselves. Thousands of customers continue to see and feel the difference!",
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any side effects associated with taking collagen powder?",
    a: [
      "Collagen powder is a source of dietary protein and is generally well tolerated when consumed as part of a balanced diet. As with many protein-rich foods, some individuals may experience mild digestive discomfort, such as bloating or a feeling of fullness, particularly when first introducing it.",
      "If you have specific dietary requirements, allergies, or medical concerns, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional before making changes to your diet.",
      "Our collagen protein powder contains no added artificial additives and is free from common allergens.",
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Can you consume too much collagen?",
    a: [
      "Collagen powder is a source of dietary protein and should be consumed as part of a balanced diet. As with any protein-rich food, consuming it in very large amounts may lead to mild digestive discomfort, such as bloating or a feeling of fullness.",
      "It's best to follow the suggested serving guidance and incorporate collagen as part of your normal daily food and drink routine. If you have specific dietary requirements or health concerns, you may wish to consult a healthcare professional before making changes to your diet.",
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Why We Use Type I and III Collagen",
    a: [
      "Our formulation combines Type I and Type III collagen, reflecting the natural composition found in the human body.",
      "Type I collagen constitutes approximately 90% of the body's total collagen content and forms the structural framework of skin, tendons, ligaments, and bones. This essential protein is a fundamental component of the skin's support structure.",
      "We've paired it with Type III collagen because in nature, these two types often work together in the same tissues. Type III collagen is found in skin, blood vessels, and organs.",
      "The Type I and III combination offers a comprehensive approach, providing the building blocks that contribute to the body's most abundant structural proteins, targeting multiple body systems simultaneously.",
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "Is Collagen Glow Up suitable for vegetarians or vegans?",
    a: [
      "No, Collagen Glow Up is not suitable for vegetarians or vegans. It contains hydrolysed collagen peptides sourced from bovine (cow) hides.",
      "Collagen peptides are derived from animal sources and are naturally present in connective tissues. This product provides Type I and Type III collagen, which are commonly found in the body.",
      "There are plant-based alternatives available, but these do not contain collagen, as collagen is not found in plant sources.",
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "How should I use collagen powder?",
    a: [
      "Add two flat tablespoons of collagen powder to food or drinks as part of your daily routine. It can be mixed into water, juice, smoothies, coffee or tea, and works well in both hot and cold options.",
      "Collagen Glow Up is virtually odourless and tasteless, making it easy to include in a variety of everyday meals and drinks.",
    ],
  },
  {
    q: "How does Collagen interact with other supplements/medications?",
    a: [
      "Collagen powder is a source of dietary protein and is generally suitable to include as part of a balanced diet. If you have any underlying health conditions or are taking prescribed medication, it's best to speak to a healthcare professional before making changes to your diet.",
